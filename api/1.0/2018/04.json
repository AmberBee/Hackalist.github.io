The competition task is to create a prototype of a mobile application with the function of augmented reality, containing elements of e-learning and gamification. The prototype has to make use of public statistical data available in the Eurostat databases (European Statistical Office) by means of API. We expect a user-friendly application with intuitive interface and attractive graphics address at teenagers aged 12-15. We are waiting for teams of 2 to 4 people. All prototypes crated during the hackathon will be evaluated by Jury and the winners will receive valuable prizes for their programs – the main prize is PLN 20,000 (equivalent of USD 5871 or EUR 4768). We speak English, but our hackathon website, registration form (https://rejestracja.stat.gov.pl/hackathon), rules (https://hackathon.stat.gov.pl/regulamin), contract template etc. are available in Polish only.
